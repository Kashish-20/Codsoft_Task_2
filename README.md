# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project aims to build a model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using a dataset containing information about various transactions. By experimenting with different machine learning algorithms, the goal is to classify transactions as either fraudulent or legitimate.


Project Overview:

Data Loading: Import the dataset containing details of credit card transactions.

Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data, addressing any missing values and standardizing formats.

Data Visualization: Visualize the data to understand the distribution of features and identify any patterns.

Data Cleaning: Further clean the dataset to remove noise and irrelevant information.

Feature Engineering: Use techniques like LabelEncoder and StandardScaler to transform and scale features for better model performance.

Model Building: Implement and train various models including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, KNN, Logistic Regression, and SVC.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of each model using metrics like the confusion matrix to assess accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Model Selection: Select the best-performing model based on the evaluation results for detecting fraudulent transactions.


Techniques and Tools:

Preprocessing: LabelEncoder, StandardScaler

Models: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, KNN, Logistic Regression, SVC

Evaluation: Confusion Matrix
